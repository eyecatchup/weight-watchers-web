# Weight-Watchers App for Windows Phone 8.1

Because the official Weightwatchers app is iOS-/Android-only, this is an unofficial alternative for Windows.

In fact, this app is just a simple Webview-Wrapper for the Weight-Watchers website, to be used as a "native" app alternative on Windows devices (phones and/or tablets). There's a version for Windows Phone 8.1 and one for Windows 10.

### Download

There's **no** released version available from the Microsoft Store. There's only the "Development version" available for direct download from the MS servers.
